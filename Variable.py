Roles to declare the variable
Variable name must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or underscore (_).

Variable name cannot start with a number.

Only letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed (no spaces or symbols).

Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, AGE = different).

You cannot use Python keywords (like for, while, class, def).

No spaces allowed — use underscore instead.

Variable name should be meaningful (best practice).

No need to specify data type — Python decides automatically.

Avoid starting variable names with capital letters unless needed.

Avoid using special characters like @, #, -, %, etc.
'''
_number="Biomedical Engineering" # this is valid
print(_number)

num12="Biomedical engineering"  # that means the integer can be used within the variable name except the starting point

print(num12,n,_number)
